# Laplacian-Blob-Detector
A program to generate blobs around areas of similar colour, texture, etc in an image.

There are 2 files which contain the code related to this project : 
final_code.m and down_sample.m. They are present in the folder “code”.


The first one contains the method where we change sigma for each slice in the scale space.
The second code contains the method where we downsample the image and then filter it with sigma as a constant.

Input and Output are present in the "data" folder.
